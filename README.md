# Comparing Cyberpunk 2077 Gamer Ages

## Exposition
As of posting this, Cyberpunk 2077 (a popular video game) is releasing tomorrow 12/09/2020 after several postponements. It is considered the most anticipated game of the decade, with teaser trailers dating back to January 2013.

## Purpose
To show how Cyberpunk 2077 ages compare to those of a similar game, Grand Theft Auto 5.

## Gathering the Data
[Source 1. 2020 Age Group Average](https://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2020-ESA_Essential_facts_070820_Final_lowres.pdf)) : shown in the table data that is presented on page 4 of the Thesa 2020 report

[Source 3. 2015 Grand Theft Auto 5](https://steamcommunity.com/app/271590/discussions/0/611703999974654762/): Is harvested via a web scrapper with Web_scrapper.py that strips the commenters information for ages.

The web scrapper for both Cyberpunk and GTA filter through HTML to ignore extranious information like Blockquotes (which are essentially quotes of another commenter) are ignored, leaving only original comments to be counted.

## Data
The data shows that the gaming industry itself is anchored in the 18-34 age ranges and the data harvested supports this.

Note: is that Cyberpunk and GTA are both rated M for Mature by ESRB. ESRB is similar to CARA who rate films: G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17. Mature meaning the game is meant for 17+.

Possible Errors:
- No way to tell if commenters are fudging the numbers, as demonstrated in the raw data (0, 9999, etc.)
- The web scrapper is simplified to take the first number it sees, however these forum posts were selected for the simplicity of commenters answers.
